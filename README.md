Transforming LOD.lu database to xdxf-like dictionary format

## Background
There is an official Luxembourgish online dictionary at https://www.lod.lu which is available only... online (from best of my knowledge). 
Sometimes it is needed to access the data without the Internet. From there came an idea to convert the LOD-xml file to a format readable by some dictionary software. 

This is an attempt to have a way of getting an offline Luxembourgish dictionary with the official articles.
